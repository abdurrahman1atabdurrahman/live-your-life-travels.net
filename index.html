    <p>Mumbai (English: /mʊmˈbaɪ/ (About this soundlisten), Marathi: [ˈmumbəi]; also known as Bombay /bɒmˈbeɪ/— the official name until 1995) is the capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra. According to the United Nations, as of 2018, Mumbai is the second-most populous city in India after Delhi and the seventh-most populous city in the world with a population of roughly 20 million.[16] As per the Indian government population census of 2011, Mumbai was the most populous city in India with an estimated city proper population of 12.5 million living under Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai.[17] Mumbai is the centre of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the sixth most populous metropolitan area in the world with a population of over 23 million.[18] Mumbai lies on the Konkan coast on the west coast of India and has a deep natural harbour. In 2008, Mumbai was named an alpha world city.[19][20] It has the highest number of millionaires and billionaires among all cities in India.[21][22] Mumbai is home to three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Elephanta Caves, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, and the city's distinctive ensemble of Victorian and Art Deco buildings designed in the 19th and 20th centuries.[23][24]</p>
    <p>The seven islands that constitute Mumbai were originally home to communities of Marathi language speaking Koli people.[25][26][27] For centuries, the seven islands of Bombay were under the control of successive indigenous rulers before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire, and subsequently to the East India Company in 1661, through the dowry of Catherine Braganza when she was married off to Charles II of England.[28] During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project,[29] which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea.[30] Along with construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Bombay in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital.[31]</p>
    <p>Mumbai is the financial, commercial,[32] and the entertainment capital of India. It is also one of the world's top ten centres of commerce in terms of global financial flow,[33] generating 6.16% of India's GDP,[34] and accounting for 25% of industrial output, 70% of maritime trade in India (Mumbai Port Trust and JNPT),[35] and 70% of capital transactions to India's economy.[36][37] Mumbai has the eighth-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world,[38] and Mumbai's billionaires had the highest average wealth of any city in the world in 2008.[39][40] The city houses important financial institutions and the corporate headquarters of numerous Indian companies and multinational corporations. It is also home to some of India's premier scientific and nuclear institutes. The city is also home to Bollywood and Marathi cinema industries. Mumbai's business opportunities attract migrants from all over India.</p>

        <h3>early history</h3>
        <p>Mumbai is built on what was once an archipelago of seven islands: Isle of Bombay, Parel, Mazagaon, Mahim, Colaba, Worli, and Old Woman's Island (also known as Little Colaba).[67] It is not exactly known when these islands were first inhabid. Pleistocene sediments found along the coastal areas around Kandivali in northern Mumbai suggest that the islands were inhabited since the South Asian Stone Age.[68] Perhaps at the beginning of the Common Era, or possibly earlier, they came to be occupied by the Koli fishing community.[69][70]

            In the 3rd century BCE, the islands formed part of the Maurya Empire, during its expansion in the south, ruled by the Buddhist emperor Ashoka of Magadha.[71] The Kanheri Caves in Borivali were excavated from basalt rock in the first century CE,[72] and served as an important centre of Buddhism in Western India during ancient Times.[73] The city then was known as Heptanesia (Ancient Greek: A Cluster of Seven Islands) to the Greek geographer Ptolemy in 150 CE.[74] The Mahakali Caves in Andheri were cut out between the 1st century BCE and the 6th century CE.[75][76]
            
            Between the 2nd century BCE and 9th century CE, the islands came under the control of successive indigenous dynasties: Satavahanas, Western Satraps, Abhira, Vakataka, Kalachuris, Konkan Mauryas, Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas,[77] before being ruled by the Shilaharas from 810 to 1260.[78] Some of the oldest edifices in the city built during this period are the Jogeshwari Caves (between 520 and 525),[79] Elephanta Caves (between the sixth to seventh century),[80] Walkeshwar Temple (10th century),[81][82] and Banganga Tank (12th century).[83][84]</p>
            <p>king bhimdev founded his kingdom in the region in the late 13th century and established his capital in Mahikawati (present day Mahim).[85] The Pathare Prabhus, among the earliest known settlers of the city, were brought to Mahikawati from Saurashtra in Gujarat around 1298 by Bhimdev.[86] The Delhi Sultanate annexed the islands in 1347–48 and controlled it until 1407. During this time, the islands were administered by the Muslim Governors of Gujarat, who were appointed by the Delhi Sultanate.[87][88]

                The islands were later governed by the independent Gujarat Sultanate, which was established in 1407. The Sultanate's patronage led to the construction of many mosques, prominent being the Haji Ali Dargah in Worli, built in honour of the Muslim saint Haji Ali in 1431.[89] From 1429 to 1431, the islands were a source of contention between the Gujarat Sultanate and the Bahmani Sultanate of Deccan.[90][91] In 1493, Bahadur Khan Gilani of the Bahmani Sultanate attempted to conquer the islands but was defeated.[92]</p>

                    <p>Mumbai is on a narrow peninsula on the southwest of Salsette Island, which lies between the Arabian Sea to the west, Thane Creek to the east and Vasai Creek to the north. Mumbai's suburban district occupies most of the island. Navi Mumbai is east of Thane Creek and Thane is north of Vasai Creek. Mumbai consists of two distinct regions: Mumbai City district and Mumbai Suburban district, which form two separate revenue districts of Maharashtra.[152] The city district region is also commonly referred to as the Island City or South Mumbai.[34] The total area of Mumbai is 603.4 km2 (233 sq mi).[153] Of this, the island city spans 67.79 km2 (26 sq mi), while the suburban district spans 370 km2 (143 sq mi), together accounting for 437.71 km2 (169 sq mi) under the administration of Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). The remaining areas belong to various Defence establishments, the Mumbai Port Trust, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Borivali National Park, which are out of the jurisdiction of the MCGM.[154] The Mumbai Metropolitan Region which includes portions of Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts in addition to Greater Mumbai, covers an area of 4,355 km2 (1681.5 sq mi).[5] Mumbai lies at the mouth of the Ulhas River on the western coast of India, in the coastal region known as the Konkan. It sits on Salsette Island (Sashti Island), which it partially shares with the Thane district.[155] Mumbai is bounded by the Arabian Sea to the west.[156] Many parts of the city lie just above sea level, with elevations ranging from 10 m (33 ft) to 15 m (49 ft);[157] the city has an average elevation of 14 m (46 ft).[158] Northern Mumbai (Salsette) is hilly,[159] and the highest point in the city is 450 m (1,476 ft) at Salsette in the Powai–Kanheri ranges.[160] The Sanjay Gandhi National Park (Borivali National Park) is located partly in the Mumbai suburban district, and partly in the Thane district, and it extends over an area of 103.09 km2 (39.80 sq mi).[161]</p>

                        <p>Apart from the Bhatsa Dam, there are six major lakes that supply water to the city: Vihar, Lower Vaitarna, Upper Vaitarna, Tulsi, Tansa and Powai. Tulsi Lake and Vihar Lake are located in Borivili National Park, within the city's limits. The supply from Powai lake, also within the city limits, is used only for agricultural and industrial purposes.[162] Three small rivers, the Dahisar River, Poinsar (or Poisar) and Ohiwara (or Oshiwara) originate within the park, while the polluted Mithi River originates from Tulsi Lake and gathers water overflowing from Vihar and Powai Lakes.[163] The coastline of the city is indented with numerous creeks and bays, stretching from the Thane creek on the eastern to Madh Marve on the western front.[164] The eastern coast of Salsette Island is covered with large mangrove swamps, rich in biodiversity, while the western coast is mostly sandy and rocky.[165]</p>
                        
                        <P>Soil cover in the city region is predominantly sandy due to its proximity to the sea. In the suburbs, the soil cover is largely alluvial and loamy.[166] The underlying rock of the region is composed of black Deccan basalt flows, and their acidic and basic variants dating back to the late Cretaceous and early Eocene eras.[167] Mumbai sits on a seismically active zone owing to the presence of 23 fault lines in the vicinity.[168] The area is classified as a Seismic Zone III region,[169] which means an earthquake of up to magnitude 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale may be expected.[170]</p>
